# PredictTreatySign
 The peace treaty prediction program in R that uses a linear model to predict the likelihood of a country signing a peace treaty based on the country's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita. CO2 emissions are a key factor in climate change, and reducing them is an important goal for many countries. Some research suggests that countries with higher CO2 emissions may be more likely to engage in conflicts and less likely to sign peace treaties.

To create the prediction model, the program uses data on CO2 emissions and peace treaty signing for a number of countries. It applies a linear model to the data to create a model that can predict the likelihood of a country signing a peace treaty based on its CO2 emissions per capita. The program can then be used to analyze the CO2 emissions of a new country and predict the likelihood of that country signing a peace treaty.
